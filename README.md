# API for convert Minecraft Java texture packs to Bedrock texture packs

## Description

It supports the follow Minecraft versions:

| Minecraft | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Java | v1.13.x, v1.14.x, v1.15.x or v1.16.x |
| Bedrock | >= v1.16.20 |

## Requirements
* This is an "ES module".
* So it requires a current web browser or NodeJS v14.
* If you need older support, please try to use something like `webpack` or `babel`

## Use it direct in your code
* Add it as a dependency to your `package.json`

```bash
yarn add github:yichifauzi/ConvertJavaTextureToBedrockApi
```

or

```bash
yarn add @yichifauzi/convert-minecraft-java-texture-to-bedrock-api
```

* You can convert your texture packs like

```javascript
import {ConsoleLog, Input, LocalFileInputEntry, LocalFileOutput} from "@yichifauzi/convert-base-api";
import {ConvertJavaTextureToBedrockApi} from "@yichifauzi/convert-minecraft-java-texture-to-bedrock-api";

(async () => {
    let output;

    try {
        output = await new ConvertJavaTextureToBedrockApi(new Input(new LocalFileInputEntry("input/java_texture_pack.zip")), new LocalFileOutput("output/bedrock_texture_pack.mcpack"), new ConsoleLog()).convert();
    } catch (err) {
        console.err(err);

        return;
    }

    console.log(`Output: ${output}`);
})();
```

## Extras (for texture pack creators)

### UUID
* You can create the `bedrock_uuid_header` and `bedrock_uuid_module` files in your input, to keep the same uuid on repeating conversions - otherwise, random uuids are generated each time and you need to reselect the texture pack again in the game

### Custom textures
* You can put custom textures in a `bedrock_textures` folder in your input.
* For instance for textures, that can not be converted or are not converted correctly.
* This files are applied additionally before output

## How this work

This project uses the follow main features or external libraries:

* [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) for convert it in the background to not freeze the browser ui (Web app)
* [jszip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jszip) for read, modify and write zip files
* [jimp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jimp) for graphic manipulation
* [file-saver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver) for deliver the converted pack to download (Web app)
* [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) for bundle the dist code (Web app)
* [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) for offline cache and usage (Web app)
